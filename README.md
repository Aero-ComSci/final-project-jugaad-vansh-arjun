This program is for anyone or any family who wants to vacation over summer in the US and it helps make it more efficient.


This program will ask the user or family who is useing this device where they would like to vacation. It first asks whether you would like to vacation in the East or West of the US. After that, it asks if you would like to visit a city or a nature site based on East or West. The code then gives you options to choose from based on your choices. Once you choose that, this code will ask how many days you are traveling for and how many people you are traveling with. After that our code will givr you the option to plan out every day of your trip and will give you examples like fishing, eating, hiking etc. but you can choose any activity that you would like. Finally our code spits out a summary of your trip and tells you to enjoy your vacation. Our code helps automate vacation planning by prompting the user what to think of when planning a vacation and helps the user choose where they would like to travel.
